This is related to CNCF cka exam. I am sharing my experince and tips to crack the cka exam in first attempt.

- CKA  is practicle lab based exam and it need extensive study on all concept of k8s.
- More you do practise , definetaly you will crack the exam.

Duration:
-Its 3 hours online exam.
- You need yur laptop, good internet connection. (Yess  no one should be in your room :) )


What you  need to study to compete the exam.
- EVERYTHING :)
- On serious note you should understand the basic  of k8s. not neccssary to do k8s hard way. 

I have never tried k8s hard way. I personally like to do installtion using kubeadm.

What I did:
- As learning I 've create 3 VM on my oracle box to build my local k8s environment.
- Installed 3 node k8s cluster using kubeadm. 
- try out different CNI plugins its good to have knowledge of different cni.
-Once you have ready env,GET ,SET,READY to play .

> Understand architecture of k8s , how its communicate  internally.
> Try out  some simple task on POD creation. Nice page for begiiners: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/
 You dont need  to learn  YAML format. you will get it by the time as  you play more with k8s object.
